# fiberSimulationServer

A web service with the purpose of simulating the behaviour of doped optical fibers.

This project is an adaptation of the work done in [this repository](https://github.com/ander-vieira/fiberSimulations); the main goals are to improve performance by switching to Java, and to provide a greater degree of usability through the web interface.
